## about my self

Hello there! I'm **Luu Dinh Van**, your friendly neighborhood software engineer. Armed with a **⌨️** and a solid **☕️**, I can conquer the front-end, tame the back-end, and even make a mobile app sit, stay, and roll over. I'm passionate about trying out new tech stacks as if they were new flavors of ice cream, and I thrive in environments that move at a pace similar to my morning runs. When I'm not building digital marvels, you can find me chasing a soccer ball, running marathons, or soaking in knowledge from audiobooks. Rumor has it that I can code faster than the speed of light, but you'll have to get in touch to find out if that's true! 😝
