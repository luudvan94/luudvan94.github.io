intro: something about me
---

Hi, I'm **Luu Dinh Van**. I work as a software engineer, where I develop for the front-end, back-end, and mobile applications. I love learning about new technology and enjoy the challenge of working in fast-paced environments. When I'm not coding, I like to play soccer, go for a run, or listen to audiobooks. If you're looking for a dedicated and hard-working engineer who loves to build and create, then I might just be your guy! üòù
