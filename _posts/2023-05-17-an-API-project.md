**Title: Day 1: The First Step on My API Development Journey**

Today was a milestone for me. The first day of my journey in learning how to develop an API. If you'd ask me, "Why an API?" Well, I've always been fascinated with the way they connect and bring data to life. I wanted to understand how they work, how they're built, and to have the ability to create one myself.

This journey is not just about gaining knowledge. It's about challenging myself, pushing my boundaries, and diving deep into the exciting world of API development. With this in mind, I decided on a project - a recipe API. A simple yet interesting topic to start with, don't you think?

For my tech stack, I decided to go with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. Ruby is known for its elegant syntax and Rails for its simplicity in building web applications. PostgreSQL, on the other hand, is a robust database system that perfectly compliments Rails.

Now, the real fun began - setting up my development environment. The first step was to install Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL. Here's how I did it:

- **Ruby:** I installed Ruby from the [official Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and checked the installation using the command `ruby -v`.
- **Rails:** I used Ruby's package manager, RubyGems, to install Rails with `gem install rails` and verified the installation with `rails -v`.
- **PostgreSQL:** The installation was done from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), and checked by running the `psql` command.

While firing up PostgreSQL, I bumped into an error: "FATAL: database 'luuvan' does not exist". Not to worry though, a quick `createdb "<db name>"` command swiftly created the necessary database, and we were back on track.

With the setup completed, I turned to the planning phase. Building an API isn't just about coding, it's about designing a system that's efficient and easy to use. I found a comprehensive guide from Microsoft on [API best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design). It was an enlightening read that I highly recommend.

And there you have it - the first day of my API development journey. It was a day filled with setup and planning, but every great journey needs a solid foundation. Stay tuned as I venture further into the world of API development.

It's just Day 1, and the journey has only just begun. With Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL at my side, I can't wait to see where this journey takes me. See you on Day 2!
