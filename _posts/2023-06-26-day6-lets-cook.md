Today, I'll share my backend planning for "Lets Cook". It's a blend of modern tools, practices, and services! 🚀

## AWS as the Backbone 🌐

I've chosen AWS (Amazon Web Services) for backend services. Its flexibility and scalability will be key to the success of "Lets Cook". 💪

## Embracing SST Framework 🧰

The Serverless Stack Toolkit (SST), an open-source framework built on AWS CDK, will be my tool for interacting with AWS, promising streamlined development and deployment. 🎁

## Dev and Prod Environments 🔧

Different AWS environments for development and production will ensure safety and prevent any accidental mishaps. 🛡️

## CI/CD Practices ⚙️

A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline will automate deployments based on pull requests, boosting efficiency. 🚀

## AWS Budgeting 💰

To avoid unexpected costs, I'll set up budget controls at the AWS account level. A smart move for financial peace of mind! 💵

## Backend, Mobile Connection, and ChatGPT 📲💬

The final goal is a robust backend for "Lets Cook", a seamless mobile connection, and an integration with the amazing ChatGPT for engaging conversations. Exciting times ahead! 🥳

Stay tuned for more updates as I dive into AWS, SST, and serverless architectures! Until then, happy cooking! 🍽️
