Day 2 of the 'Let's Cook' application project commences with a comprehensive exploration of modularization. As the sole proprietor, my strategy revolves around a modularized architectural pattern, primarily for its systematic, organized structure that facilitates the addition of new features. The focal point for this phase is Phrase 1, encapsulating the 'Recipe Searching' functionality.

The application has been segregated into primary modules:

- **App**: Acts as the orchestrator, coordinating all features and modules seamlessly. 🎼
- **Recipe Searching**: Provides an intuitive interface for users to perform recipe searches. 🔍
- **Shared UI**: Houses universal user interface elements, inclusive of SwiftUI's built-in components. 🧰
- **Shared Network**: Serves as the cornerstone for enabling communication with APIs across modules. 🌐

The following schematic diagram offers a visual representation of the architecture:

Each module adheres to a three-layered architecture: Presentation, Business, and Data.

- **Presentation**: Constitutes the front-facing layer, comprising user interface elements and functional components. 🎬
- **Business**: Serves as the logical hub, forming a bridge between the presentation and data layers. 💼
- **Data**: Facilitates data provision, managing connections with APIs and databases. 💾

Their interrelations are illustrated in the subsequent graph:

The modularization approach, undoubtedly, amplifies the efficiency of the 'Let's Cook' project. The progression will encompass the addition of more features as we move forward. Stay abreast of the latest updates. 👨‍🍳📲🚀
